# Work In Progress  
## VRCPlates (Classic Plates)
A modification to bring the beloved nameplates of 2018 VRChat to ChilloutVR.

![Classic Nameplates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FSCodingWaifu/VRChatMods/main/classic_nameplate.png)

### Features
- Profile Pictures
- Rank and Customizable colors
- Resizable and Adjustable
- Developer Tags

### Compatability Notes  

***Nameplates are seperate objects and will not impede on other mod features, you can disable or enable the nameplates live within the game to access incompatible features***
> Directly editing your MelonPreferences.cfg file will not update the nameplates and cause issues.

- Nameplate Stats 
- Avatar Loading Bars
- Setting Presets
