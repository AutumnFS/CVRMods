# Released Mods

A modification to bring the beloved nameplates of 2018 VRChat to ChilloutVR.

## Disclaimer  
> ***All assets within this mod were created from scratch with the core premise of recreating the original experience of VRChat. These assets are not owned or endorsed by VRChat.***
> ***Furthermore, these nameplates operate under the guidelines set by the CEO of ABI for nameplate modification by prominently displaying staff***

### Features
- Profile Pictures
- Rank and Customizable colors
- Resizable and Adjustable
- Developer Tags

### Compatability Notes  

***Nameplates are seperate objects and will not impede on other mod features, you can disable or enable the nameplates live within the game to access incompatible features***
> Directly editing your MelonPreferences.cfg file will not update the nameplates and cause issues.

### Known Issues
> There is an error thrown from method `NameplateManager.SetRawImage` for Error 404. This is due to Profile Pictures being broken on ABI's end and is the same error thrown for the normal nameplates as well

### Work in Progress
- Badge instantiation 
- Nameplate Stats 
- Avatar Loading Bars
- Setting Presets 


# Planned Mods  
## World Map 
Adds an interactable map into the game, either attached to your hand, on your hud, or evn *possibly* as a spawnable table.
### Planned Features
- Spawnable Map Table  
- Hud details such as Coordinates and a Compass  
- Visible waypoints/beacons  
- Player Locator
